Learning Doc, Assignment 5

	This time around, there wasn't a whole lot to learn. I was familiar with
	the concept of morse code, binary trees, etc. before the project was
	assigned, so I didn't have any trouble visualizing what needed to happen
	or what the requirements were.
	
	The inorder traversal was the most difficult part, but thinking less about 
	the individual casess and more about the purpose of its inclusion helped
	develop a working method.
	
	This assignment was mostly smooth sailing. Can't wait to get started on 
	assignment 6!
