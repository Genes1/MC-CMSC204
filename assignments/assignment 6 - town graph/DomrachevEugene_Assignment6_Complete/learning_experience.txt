Learning Doc, Assignment 6

	Much of this project was playing around with the impementation
	of the necessary methods. I opted to use the adjacency list 
	approach which I implemented with a hashmap for both roads and towns,
	but I feel like there is a much better way to do this. They both shared
	keysets (being the towns in the graph), but did not hold the same 
	information, so I could not think of a more intuitive way. I could
	have made the value for the hashmap an array of both the roads and 
	towns connected to the key, but this is a little convoluted.
	
	I wonder if the array approach was harder to implement dijstrka's 
	algorithm with. I felt that the most difficult part was just the control
	logic, not really the system I had set up with my variables. 
	
	While finishing the assignment, I realized I had not pushed a single time 
	to my remote repo! While the risk of losing my computer/data is fairly low,
	I still should still keep up the practice. It lets me access the code I have already
	written from my phone if I wish to revisit it, and also (most importantly)
	acts as my backup copy in case trageddy strikes. 
	
	That's all for this course, sadly. I did enjoy these projects, they were very 
	good practice for the development process.
