	This was my first insight into an actual structured project with concrete requirements. Having these guidelines,
	as well as a described goal to reach (using class content) made for an enjoyable project. It was my first foray into 
	JavaFX and JUnit tests, but I got the hang of them pretty quickly. They are definitely something I'll consider
	using in my personal projects going forward, JUnit especially.
	
	A couple of lesons learned:
	
	- Start well ahead of time. Yes, the project is doable in a couple days, but the time spent perfecting everything should be distributed.
	- Read documentation very carefully, and try to make sure with a colleague/administrator what's expected.
	- Driver classes and class structure distribution make for much cleaner codebases than does a very long single file.
	- Pseudocode can be easily translated into whatever language you are using, so just make it as a prerequisite. Very convenient.
	
	Overall, I think this is a good project to review workflow and some previously covered concepts for CS1 students.
	
	Thank you for reading! Please let me know anything I should change in future projects.
